# A simple module for operations on mass-spectra.

## Project goals:

* have a basic object for representing spectra and doing operations not involving other objects, like:
	* simple denoising routines
		* peak height
		* intensity content
	* spectra aggregation routines:
		* trivial addition of spectra
	* centroiding
		* for count-based spectra
		* FT-based spectra
	* plotting:
		* matplotlib
		* dumping to html's
			* plotly
	* reading from basic formats
		* ascii
